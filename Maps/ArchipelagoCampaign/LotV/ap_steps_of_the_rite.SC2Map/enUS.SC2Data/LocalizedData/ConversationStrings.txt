Conversation/pMission_Taldarim01/Line00456=Oh, Gary. Wait. I didn't mean it like that. 
Conversation/pMission_Taldarim01/Line00457=You can feed on their Mecha Remnants to become more powerful... hahahahaha... AH-HAHAHAHAAA!
Conversation/pMission_Taldarim01/Line00458=...hahahaha, ah, oh-ho, I always knew you had it in you. Really. You will be what I'm remembered for. Get over here and give me a hug, you rascal!
Conversation/pMission_Taldarim01/Line00459=Do you hear that? It's the terrazine moving beneath the surface. Ooh, more geysers are on the way.
Conversation/pMission_Taldarim01/Line00460=This terrazine is about to become TERRANzine. Bwahaha! What, nothing? Oh come on.
Conversation/pMission_Taldarim01/Line00461=We've got the start of a good terrazine cache! But my research is going to require some more.

Conversation/pMission_Taldarim01/Line00463=Hey um, did you happen to save any of the extracted terrazine? No? Okay... well, that's okay...
